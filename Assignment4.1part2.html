        <h2>The history of My college class storytelling</h2>
        <p>It was in my First class in the second semester, we were doing an assignment on testing inputs and outputs in python coding, any I thought, why not make an interactive story out of this. And so, I got to work on my very first app dubbed "The Saturn Expirement". this story included a post apocolyptic world infested with mutants, however with peaceful ones, and we also follow a character where he/she is transported to the same future. The success afterwards felt amazing so I then procceed to do the same to every code I do and this transitioned to an adventure story, another post apocolyptic story, and even an action story. today I thought I would share a bit of that history with you in this site called "Broken Tavern Tales" In which is dedicated to one-shot stories in this page.</p>
